# [OverClocked JukeBox](http://ocjb.pw)

A no-fuss web player for [OC ReMixes](http://ocremix.org)

If you like game music and have never heard of OCR, you'll enjoy this.

A few of my favorites are:

* [The Unbroken](http://ocjb.pw/#track-2363) (Cave Story),
* [Immortalized](http://ocjb.pw/#track-2213) (Halo 3),
* [Day's End](http://ocjb.pw/#track-1706) (Mario Kart 64), and
* [Falling Back](http://ocjb.pw/#track-1435) (Ocarina of Time).

Click any track to play it. Download links are provided. If you download a lot, [donate back some bandwidth](http://ocremix.org/torrents) by using one of the torrents.
